# Tic-Tac-Toe
A project created before I learned OOP <br/>
* The computer actively tries to win if it has 2 in a row then tries to block the player if they have 2 in a row <br/>
* Computer defaults to a random location if the board does not currently meet any of it's predefined logic <br/>
* The game is replayable and keeps track of wins and losses (Not permanent, does not store to a text file)
